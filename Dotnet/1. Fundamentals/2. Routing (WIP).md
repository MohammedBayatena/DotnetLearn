[Routing in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

Routing is responsible for matching incoming HTTP requests and dispatching those requests to the app's executable endpoints. [Endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-8.0#endpoints) are the app's units of executable request-handling code. Endpoints are defined in the app and configured when the app starts. The endpoint matching process can extract values from the request's URL and provide those values for request processing. Using endpoint information from the app, routing is also able to generate URLs that map to endpoints.

Apps can configure routing using:

- Controllers
- Razor Pages
- SignalR
- gRPC Services
- Endpoint-enabled [middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) such as [Health Checks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-8.0).
- Delegates and lambdas registered with routing.

## Routing basics

The following code shows a basic example of routing:

```C#
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

The preceding example includes a single endpoint using the [MapGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.endpointroutebuilderextensions.mapget) method:

- When an HTTP `GET` request is sent to the root URL `/`:
    - The request delegate executes.
    - `Hello World!` is written to the HTTP response.
- If the request method is not `GET` or the root URL is not `/`, no route matches and an HTTP 404 is returned.

Routing uses a pair of middleware, registered by [UseRouting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.endpointroutingapplicationbuilderextensions.userouting) and [UseEndpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.endpointroutingapplicationbuilderextensions.useendpoints):

- `UseRouting` adds route matching to the middleware pipeline. This middleware looks at the set of endpoints defined in the app, and selects the [best match](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-8.0#urlm) based on the request.
- `UseEndpoints` adds endpoint execution to the middleware pipeline. It runs the delegate associated with the selected endpoint.

Apps typically don't need to call `UseRouting` or `UseEndpoints`. [WebApplicationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.webapplicationbuilder) configures a middleware pipeline that wraps middleware added in `Program.cs` with `UseRouting` and `UseEndpoints`. However, apps can change the order in which `UseRouting` and `UseEndpoints` run by calling these methods explicitly. For example, the following code makes an explicit call to `UseRouting`:

```C#
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // ...
    await next(context);
});

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
```

In the preceding code:

- The call to `app.Use` registers a custom middleware that runs at the start of the pipeline.
- The call to `UseRouting` configures the route matching middleware to run _after_ the custom middleware.
- The endpoint registered with `MapGet` runs at the end of the pipeline.

If the preceding example didn't include a call to `UseRouting`, the custom middleware would run _after_ the route matching middleware.

## Endpoints

The `MapGet` method is used to define an **endpoint**. An endpoint is something that can be:

- Selected, by matching the URL and HTTP method.
- Executed, by running the delegate.

Endpoints that can be matched and executed by the app are configured in `UseEndpoints`. For example, [MapGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.endpointroutebuilderextensions.mapget), [MapPost](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.endpointroutebuilderextensions.mappost), and [similar methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.endpointroutebuilderextensions) connect request delegates to the routing system. Additional methods can be used to connect ASP.NET Core framework features to the routing system:

- [MapRazorPages for Razor Pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.razorpagesendpointroutebuilderextensions.maprazorpages)
- [MapControllers for controllers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.controllerendpointroutebuilderextensions.mapcontrollers)
- [`MapHub<THub> for SignalR`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.signalr.hubroutebuilder.maphub)
- [`MapGrpcService<TService> for gRPC`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/aspnetcore?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

The following example shows routing with a more sophisticated route template:

C#Copy

```
app.MapGet("/hello/{name:alpha}", (string name) => $"Hello {name}!");
```

The string `/hello/{name:alpha}` is a **route template**. A route template is used to configure how the endpoint is matched. In this case, the template matches:

- A URL like `/hello/Docs`
- Any URL path that begins with `/hello/` followed by a sequence of alphabetic characters. `:alpha` applies a route constraint that matches only alphabetic characters. [Route constraints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-8.0#route-constraints) are explained later in this article.

The second segment of the URL path, `{name:alpha}`:

- Is bound to the `name` parameter.
- Is captured and stored in [HttpRequest.RouteValues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest.routevalues).


## Endpoint metadata

Endpoints can have extra data attached to them. This extra data is called endpoint **metadata**:

- The metadata can be processed by routing-aware middleware.
- The metadata can be of any .NET type.
