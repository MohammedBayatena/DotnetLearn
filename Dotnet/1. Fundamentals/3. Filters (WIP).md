[Filters in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-9.0)

_Filters_ in ASP.NET Core allow code to run before or after specific stages in the request processing pipeline.

Built-in filters handle tasks such as:

- Authorization, preventing access to resources a user isn't authorized for.
- Response caching, short-circuiting the request pipeline to return a cached response.

Custom filters can be created to handle cross-cutting concerns. Examples of cross-cutting concerns include error handling, caching, configuration, authorization, and logging. Filters avoid duplicating code. For example, an error handling exception filter could consolidate error handling.

This document applies to Razor Pages, API controllers, and controllers with views. Filters don't work directly with [Razor components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/?view=aspnetcore-9.0). A filter can only indirectly affect a component when:

- The component is embedded in a page or view.
- The page or controller and view uses the filter.


## How filters work

Filters run within the _ASP.NET Core action invocation pipeline_, sometimes referred to as the _filter pipeline_. The filter pipeline runs after ASP.NET Core selects the action to execute:

The request is processed through Other Middleware, Routing Middleware, Action Selection, and the Action Invocation Pipeline. The request processing continues back through Action Selection, Routing Middleware, and various Other Middleware before becoming a response sent to the client.

## Filter types

Each filter type is executed at a different stage in the filter pipeline:

- [Authorization filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-9.0#authorization-filters):
    
    - Run first.
    - Determine whether the user is authorized for the request.
    - Short-circuit the pipeline if the request is not authorized.
- [Resource filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-9.0#resource-filters):
    
    - Run after authorization.
    - [OnResourceExecuting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.filters.iresourcefilter.onresourceexecuting) runs code before the rest of the filter pipeline. For example, `OnResourceExecuting` runs code before model binding.
    - [OnResourceExecuted](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.filters.iresourcefilter.onresourceexecuted) runs code after the rest of the pipeline has completed.
- [Action filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-9.0#action-filters):
    
    - Run immediately before and after an action method is called.
    - Can change the arguments passed into an action.
    - Can change the result returned from the action.
    - Are **not** supported in Razor Pages.
- [Endpoint filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/min-api-filters):
    
    - Run immediately before and after an action method is called.
    - Can change the arguments passed into an action.
    - Can change the result returned from the action.
    - Are **not** supported in Razor Pages.
    - Can be invoked on both actions and route handler-based endpoints.
- [Exception filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-9.0#exception-filters):
    
    - Apply global policies to unhandled exceptions that occur before the response body has been written to.
    - Run after model binding and action filters, but before the action result is executed.
    - Run only if an unhandled exception occurs during action execution or action result execution.
    - Do not run for exceptions thrown during middleware execution, routing, or model binding.
- [Result filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-9.0#result-filters):
    
    - Run immediately before and after the execution of action results.
    - Run only when the action method executes successfully.
    - Are useful for logic that must surround view or formatter execution.

## Implementation

Filters support both synchronous and asynchronous implementations through different interface definitions.

Synchronous filters run before and after their pipeline stage. For example, [OnActionExecuting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.filters.iactionfilter.onactionexecuting) is called before the action method is called. [OnActionExecuted](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.filters.iactionfilter.onactionexecuted) is called after the action method returns:

C#Copy

```
public class SampleActionFilter : IActionFilter
{
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        // Do something before the action executes.
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        // Do something after the action executes.
    }
}
```

Asynchronous filters define an `On-Stage-ExecutionAsync` method. For example, [OnActionExecutionAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.filters.iasyncactionfilter.onactionexecutionasync):

C#Copy

```
public class SampleAsyncActionFilter : IAsyncActionFilter
{
    public async Task OnActionExecutionAsync(
        ActionExecutingContext context, ActionExecutionDelegate next)
    {
        // Do something before the action executes.
        await next();
        // Do something after the action executes.
    }
}
```

In the preceding code, the `SampleAsyncActionFilter` has an [ActionExecutionDelegate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.filters.actionexecutiondelegate), `next`, which executes the action method.
