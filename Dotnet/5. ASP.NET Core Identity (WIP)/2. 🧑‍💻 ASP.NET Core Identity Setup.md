## 🧑‍💻 ASP.NET Core Identity Setup Step-by-Step:

### Step 1:  Installing Required NuGet Packages

```csharp
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
```
### Step 2: Define the Database Context Class

The IdentityDbContext class in ASP.NET Core Identity plays an important role in integrating the Identity system with Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core applications. This class inherits from DbContext in Entity Framework Core and is designed to manage the database context for the identity data. That means the IdentityDbContext provides the necessary setup to manage user authentication and authorization data in a database.

* Create `ApplicationDbContext.cs`

```csharp
public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
    {
    }
}
```

* Register the IdentityDbContext Inside `Program.cs`

```csharp
//Add the DBContext
builder
    .Services
    .AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(opt =>
    {
        opt.UseInMemoryDatabase(databaseName: "Identity");
    });
```
### Step 3: Configure ASP.NET Core Identity Services

The AddIdentity Method registers the required ASP.NET Core Identity services into the dependency injection (DI) container. The **AddIdentity** method requires two type parameters – one for the user and one for the role. You can directly specify IdentityUser and IdentityRole classes or any types derived from IdentityUser and IdentityRole, respectively.

* Register `Identity` Inside `Program.cs`

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>()
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores<IdentityDbContext>()
```


### Step 4. Add Authentication Middleware to the Request Pipeline

In the `Program.cs` class file, add `app.UseAuthentication()` and `app.UseAuthorization()`

```csharp
//Configuring Authentication Middleware to the Request Pipeline
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
```


## 📘 Notes: 

## 🚀 Differences Between AddIdentity and AddIdentityCore in ASP.NET Core Identity

In ASP.NET Core Identity, AddIdentity and AddIdentityCore are two methods used to register the identity services into the built-in dependency injection container, but they serve different purposes and have different scopes of functionality. Let us understand the differences between them:

**AddIdentity**:

- AddIdentity is used to add the full identity system to the application, including user and role management and UI support.
- It registers services like UserManager, RoleManager, SignInManager, and others essential for handling user and role operations.
- It is ideal for applications where a complete identity system with user interface components for registration, login, etc., is required.
- Typically, AddIdentity is used in ASP.NET Core MVC applications where views and controllers are used.

**AddIdentityCore**:

- This method is useful when you need the basic identity functionality without the additional overhead of the full identity system.
- AddIdentityCore registers only the core services of ASP.NET Core Identity, such as UserManager and RoleManager. 
- It does not register services related to sign-in, cookies, or any UI components.
- It’s ideal for API-based projects (like ASP.NET Core Web API) where we manage the authentication flow (like token-based authentication) and do not require the built-in UI and cookie-based authentication mechanisms.
