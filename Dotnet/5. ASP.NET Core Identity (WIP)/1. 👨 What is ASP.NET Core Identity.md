## üîç What is ASP.NET Core Identity?

ASP.NET Core Identity is a Membership Management System that provides login functionality to the application, such as user registration, sign-in, sign-out, password recovery, account lockout, account verification via SMS and Email, role-based authentication, claim-based authentication, third-party authentication, external authentication, two-factor authentication, etc.

The following are some of the key features of ASP.NET Core Identity:

- **User Management:**¬†ASP.NET Core Identity provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and querying user accounts. That means managing the User data.

- **Roles Management:**¬†ASP.NET Core Identity supports role-based authorization. We can create Roles for our application, and then these Roles are assigned to the users.

- **Password Management:**¬†It has built-in functionality for password hashing, password validation policies, account lockout, and other security features to protect user accounts.

- **User Authentication:**¬†It provides functionality for authenticating users. Authentication is the process of determining a user‚Äôs identity.

- **User Authorization:**¬†Once a user is authenticated, ASP.NET Core Identity can authorize user access to certain resources or functionalities within an application based on roles or claims.

- **Roles-Based Authentication:**¬†This type of Authentication Allows users to be assigned roles, which can be used for identity and access control. That means, based on the roles assigned to the user, we can restrict access to certain resources.

- **Claims-Based Authentication:**¬†This type of authentication allows users to be assigned claims, which can be used for identity and access control, similar to Role-based Authentication.

- **External Login Providers:**¬†ASP.NET Core Identity supports integration with external authentication providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**¬†It supports two-factor authentication (2FA), enhancing the security of your application by requiring a second form of user verification.

- **Customizable and Extensible:**¬†It allows us to customize the User Model, Role Model, and Validation Logic and integrate them with existing databases.

- **Security Features:**¬†It also supports account confirmation, password recovery, and prevention against common attacks like SQL Injection, CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

## üîçASP.NET Core Identity Key Components:

The following are the key components of ASP.NET Core Identity:

###### **Identity Core Components:**

Using the following components, we can perform different types of operations. Basically, the following are classes in ASP.NET Core Identity, which provides many methods for performing different operations on the Identity database.

- **UserManager:**¬†This class in ASP.NET Core Identity is responsible for managing users in the application. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving user information from the ASP.NET Core Identity database.
- **RoleManager:**¬†This class in ASP.NET Core Identity is responsible for managing roles in the application. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, retrieving roles, and assigning them to users.
- **SignInManager:**¬†This class in ASP.NET Core Identity handles sign-in and sign-out operations and provides functionalities for two-factor authentication and external authentication.

###### **Data Models:**

The following are the Model classes in ASP.NET Core Identity used to hold the data in memory.

- **IdentityUser:**¬†This is the default User class in ASP.NET Core Identity, which includes common properties like UserName, Email, PhoneNumber, etc. This class can also be extended to include custom properties for additional user information as per your business requirements, such as First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, etc.
- **IdentityRole:**¬†This is the default Role class in ASP.NET Core Identity. It stores Role information such as Role ID and Name. This class can also be extended to include custom role information, such as Role Description.

###### **IdentityDbContext:**

- **IdentityDbContext:**¬†This is the Identity Context Class Inherited from the Entity Framework Core DbContext class. This class is responsible for interacting with the ASP.NET Core Identity database that stores the identity data.
