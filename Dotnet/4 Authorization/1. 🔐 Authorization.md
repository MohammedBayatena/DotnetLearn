**Authorization** is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It comes **after authentication** and involves checking a user’s **permissions**, **roles**, or **claims** to grant or deny access to resources or actions in a system.

## 🔍Key Topics in Authorization

1. **Roles**
    
    - Roles are predefined labels assigned to users, like _Admin_, _Editor_, or _Viewer_.
        
    - Users with specific roles can perform actions permitted to that role.
        
    - Simplifies management of permissions across many users.
        
    - Common in RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) systems.
        
    - Roles are typically static and assigned during or after user creation.
        
2. **Policies**
    
    - Policies are rules that define the conditions under which access is granted.
        
    - They can include role checks, value comparisons, or custom logic.
        
    - More flexible than roles alone.
        
    - Used to express complex authorization logic.
        
    - Often implemented via policy-based authorization systems.
        
3. **Claims**
    
    - Claims are pieces of information about the user, like email, department, or clearance level.
        
    - Used to make fine-grained decisions based on user attributes.
        
    - Part of token-based systems (like JWT).
        
    - Enable attribute-based access control (ABAC).
        
    - Claims are usually issued by an identity provider during authentication.
        
4. **Permissions**
    
    - Permissions define specific actions that can be performed on resources (e.g., _read_, _write_).
        
    - Often tied to roles or directly assigned to users or groups.
        
    - Helps enforce the principle of least privilege.
        
    - Can be stored in a database or configuration.
        
    - Used in systems with fine-grained access needs.
        
5. **Access Control Models**
    
    - Various models govern how access is granted, including:
        
        - **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control
            
        - **ABAC**: Attribute-Based Access Control
            
        - **PBAC**: Policy-Based Access Control
            
        - **DAC/MAC**: Discretionary or Mandatory Access Control
            
    - Each model suits different use cases and security requirements.
        
    - The choice depends on system complexity and compliance needs.

## 🔍🧑‍💻Authorization in .NET

In .NET (particularly ASP.NET Core), authorization is a built-in framework feature and supports multiple methods:

1. **Role-Based Authorization**
    
    - Use `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` on controllers or actions.
        
    - Roles are often assigned via claims or during user creation.
        
    - Simple and effective for many applications.
        
2. **Policy-Based Authorization**
    
    - Define policies in `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` in .NET 6+):
        
        ```csharp
        services.AddAuthorization(options =>
        {
            options.AddPolicy("RequireAdmin", 
            policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
        });
        ```
        
    - Apply using `[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdmin")]`.
        
    - Supports multiple requirements including custom ones.
        
3. **Claims-Based Authorization**
    
    - Policies can require specific claims:
        
        ```csharp
        policy.RequireClaim("Department", "HR");
        ```
        
    - Useful for attribute-based checks like department or country.
        
4. **Custom Authorization Handlers**
    
    - Implement `IAuthorizationHandler` for advanced scenarios.
        
    - Allow full control over how policies are enforced.
        
    - Great for multi-tenant or data-level access control.
        
5. **Resource-Based Authorization**
    
    - Authorize access to specific instances of resources (e.g., a document owned by a user).
        
    - Uses `IAuthorizationService` manually in code:
        
        ```csharp
        var result = await _authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(
        User, 
        resource, 
        "PolicyName");
        ```
        
    - Often used in APIs with entity-level security.
