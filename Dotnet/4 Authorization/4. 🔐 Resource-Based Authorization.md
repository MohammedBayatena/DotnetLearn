**Resource-Based Authorization** is a technique in ASP.NET Core where access is granted based on both the **user's identity** and a specific **resource instance** (e.g., a document, order, or record). It uses `IAuthorizationService` to check if the user is allowed to perform an action on that specific resource at runtime.

---
## üîçOverview

Resource-based authorization is used when access to a resource depends on both the **user** and the **specific resource instance**, such as:

- A user editing only their own blog posts.
    
- A manager accessing reports for their team.
    

This cannot be expressed by roles alone and requires contextual logic.

## üîçHow It Works

You use the `IAuthorizationService` interface to programmatically evaluate a policy **against a resource instance**.

## üßë‚ÄçüíªResource-Based Authorization in Dotnet

#### 1. Define Requirement

```csharp
public class SameAuthorRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement { }
```

#### 2. Implement Handler

```csharp
public class SameAuthorHandler : 
AuthorizationHandler<SameAuthorRequirement, BlogPost>
{
    protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
    AuthorizationHandlerContext context,
    SameAuthorRequirement requirement,
    BlogPost resource)
    {
        var userId = context.User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
        if (resource.AuthorId == userId)
        {
            context.Succeed(requirement);
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Register the Handler

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IAuthorizationHandler, SameAuthorHandler>();
```

### 4. Use in Controller or Service

```csharp
public class BlogController : Controller
{
    private readonly IAuthorizationService _authService;

    public BlogController(IAuthorizationService authService)
    {
        _authService = authService;
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Edit(int id)
    {
        var post = _db.BlogPosts.Find(id);

        var result = await _authService.AuthorizeAsync(
        User, 
        post, 
        new SameAuthorRequirement());
        if (!result.Succeeded)
        {
            return Forbid();
        }

        return View(post);
    }
}
```

## üöÄ When to Use Custom or Resource-Based Authorization

| Scenario                                   | Use This       |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| User must be at least a certain age        | Custom Handler |
| Access to a document depends on ownership  | Resource-Based |
| Require multiple claims for access         | Custom Handler |
| Check if a user can modify specific entity | Resource-Based |
| Centralized, reusable business logic       | Custom Handler |
