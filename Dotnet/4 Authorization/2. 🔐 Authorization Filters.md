**Authorization Filters** are part of the ASP.NET Core **filter pipeline** used to enforce security **before** executing controller actions. They work at the MVC level and allow you to run custom logic to allow or deny access **before** an action method is executed.

---
#### 🔍 Key Points

- Authorization filters implement the `IAuthorizationFilter` or `IAsyncAuthorizationFilter` interface.
    
- They run **early in the request pipeline**, before model binding and action execution.
    
- They are typically used for **custom logic** that doesn't fit cleanly into the built-in `[Authorize]` attribute or the policy system.
    
- Unlike `IAuthorizationService`, filters are **declarative** and applied via attributes.
    
- You can short-circuit the request by setting the `context.Result` (e.g., to `ForbidResult` or `UnauthorizedResult`).

#### 🔍 When to Use Authorization Filters

- You need **fine-grained control** over access logic at the MVC filter level.
    
- You want to apply **custom access checks** outside of the built-in policy-based system.
    
- You are enforcing authorization **based on route data**, headers, or other early request details.

#### 🧑‍💻 Authorization Filters in Dotnet

##### 1. Custom Authorization Filter

```csharp
public class MinimumAgeAuthorizeAttribute : Attribute, IAuthorizationFilter
{
    private readonly int _minimumAge;

    public MinimumAgeAuthorizeAttribute(int minimumAge)
    {
        _minimumAge = minimumAge;
    }

    public void OnAuthorization(AuthorizationFilterContext context)
    {
        var user = context.HttpContext.User;
        var dobClaim = user.FindFirst("DateOfBirth");

        if (dobClaim == null || !DateTime.TryParse(dobClaim.Value, out var dob))
        {
            context.Result = new ForbidResult();
            return;
        }

        int age = DateTime.Today.Year - dob.Year;
        if (dob > DateTime.Today.AddYears(-age)) age--;

        if (age < _minimumAge)
        {
            context.Result = new ForbidResult();
        }
    }
}
```

##### 2. Usage on Controller/Action

```csharp
[MinimumAgeAuthorize(21)]
public IActionResult AlcoholContent()
{
    return View();
}
```

### 🚀 Authorization Filter vs Policy-Based Authorization

| Feature                         | Authorization Filter        | Policy-Based Authorization              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Runs at                         | MVC level (filters)         | Middleware + `IAuthorizationService`    |
| Custom Logic                    | Highly flexible             | Requires setup with requirements        |
| Declarative Use                 | Yes (attributes)            | Yes (via `[Authorize(Policy = "...")]`) |
| Access to route/request headers | Yes                         | Limited                                 |
| Best For                        | Custom, early checks in MVC | Claims, roles, policies                 |
