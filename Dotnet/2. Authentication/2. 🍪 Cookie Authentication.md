#### 🔍**Cookies**: 

Traditional form login where credentials are stored in cookies for maintaining sessions. Cookies is one of the oldest and easiest types of storing users information.

Cookies are essential for enhancing website functionality by enabling websites to remember user preferences, login details, and other information. Here's a detailed breakdown of their components and functionalities and the .NET defaults:

1. **Name**: The unique identifier for the cookie, allowing the browser to recognize which data pertains to which website. The default value for cookie Name is .AspNetCore.Cookies. This value should be changed if you change the name of the AuthenticationScheme, especially if your system uses the cookie authentication handler multiple times.
    
2. **Value**: The actual data stored, such as usernames or authentication tokens, used to track user behavior and preferences.
    
3. **Domain**: Specifies which websites can access the cookie, ensuring that cookies are domain-specific (e.g., example.com).
    
4. **Path**: Determines specific paths within a domain where the cookie is valid, useful for structuring site-wide functionality. If you request a cookie at a lower path level (e.g., `/login`), the cookie will be created and sent only with requests to that specific path or its sub-paths. For example, setting the cookie on `/login` ensures it is created only when visiting that path and is included only in requests within `/login`.
    
5. **Expiration Time**: Indicates when the cookie should be deleted, allowing for persistent or session-based cookies. Cookies usually expires when the session is over (closing the browser)
    
6. **Secure Flag**: Ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS, enhancing security by preventing transmission over insecure connections. Defaults to SameAsRequest
    
7. **HTTP-Only Flag**: Prevents JavaScript from accessing cookie data, mitigating risks like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The default is true, which means the cookie will only be passed to HTTP requests and is not made available to JavaScript on the page.
    
8. **Same-Site Attribute**: Restricts sending cookies with cross-origin requests to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by controlling how cookies are shared between sites. The default is Lax, which means the cookie is only allowed to be attached to cross-site requests using safe HTTP methods and same-site requests.
    
9. **Partition**: Separates cookies into secure compartments based on attributes like secure or HTTP-only, preventing access across different contexts and enhancing security.
    
10. **Port Number**: Specifies the port used for communication, though typically handled at the domain level without explicit port specification.
    

These attributes are set in the HTTP response header's Set-Cookie field by the server. Cookies improve user experience by personalizing visits but require careful management to ensure security. Understanding each part helps in utilizing cookies effectively while mitigating potential risks.

#### 📘 **Notes**:

- **In .NET, the Default Cookie attribute values can be changed by changing the Cookie options as in the code snippet below**

	```
	.AddCookie("ExampleCookie", o =>  
	{  
		o.Cookie.Name = "MyCustomName";  // Default, .AspNetCore.Cookie
		o.Cookie.Domain = "mydomain.com"; // Default, current domain
		o.Cookie.Path = "/";
		o.Cookie.HttpOnly = true; // Default, True
		o.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always; //Defaut, SameAsRequest
		o.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax; // Default Lax
		o.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);  //Defaukt, 14Days
		o.SlidingExpiration = true;
	});
	```

-  **When a Cookie Value (Payload) is large**, .NET  will split the cookie into multiple chunks and will recombine them later when adding them to the request header. Having too much data in cookies is a bad practice, data about user should be fetched from database or cache (Redis,..)

-  **Setting the Cookie as HTTP Only**, means that the browser cannot access the cookie directly. It will only be appended into requests inside the header. The latter helps in preventing `Cross Site Scripting` (XSS) attacks.

- **🚨 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks: A Simple Explanation**
	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These attacks can compromise user data, steal session tokens, or manipulate website functionality.
 
	 1. How XSS Works:
	    
		1. **Injection of Malicious Scripts**: Attackers exploit websites by injecting harmful scripts through user inputs like comments, forms, or search queries.
		2. **Execution in Victim's Browser**: When an unsuspecting user views a page with the injected script, their browser executes the script as part of the webpage, leading to potential data theft or unauthorized access.
		   
	2.  Types of XSS Attacks:

		1. **Stored XSS**: Malicious scripts are saved on the targeted website's server and executed every time the affected page is viewed.
		2. **Non-Persistent XSS**: Scripts are injected during a single session or interaction and do not persist beyond that.
		   
	3. Examples:

		1. **Comment Injection**:
		    
		    - An attacker injects a script into a user comment section. When other users view the comment, their browsers execute the script, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to malicious sites.
		2. **Login Form Manipulation**:
		    
		    - A malicious script injected into a login form captures inputted credentials and sends them to an attacker's server, enabling unauthorized access.
	   - More Examples can be tried at https://xss-game.appspot.com/

	4. Prevention Measures:
		1. Input Validation and Sanitization: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized before being displayed on the website.
		2. Secure Coding Practices: Use secure coding frameworks that handle validations automatically.
		3. User Awareness: Educate users to be cautious of suspicious links and keep their browsers updated with security patches.

- **Same-Site Attribute** has four main values, Unspecified, Lax, None and Strict. The same site flag is important to protect from Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). 

	- None: Enables CSRF attacks
	- Lax: Only enable redirects of get endpoints from external sites
	- Strict: No external redirection requests requests from other sites are accepted. all requests should come from the same site
	- Unspecified: will result in the browser using Lax by default

- **🚨 Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): A Simple Explanation**

	1. **Definition**: CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a type of cyber attack where an attacker tricks a user into performing actions they did not intend to on a website.
	   
	2. **Mechanism**:
	    - The user is first logged into a trusted website (e.g., their bank account).
	    - The attacker sends the user a malicious link or tricks them into visiting another site controlled by the attacker.
	    - This site uses techniques to make the user's browser send unintended requests to the trusted website, leveraging the existing session cookie.
	      
	3.  **Example Scenario**:
		- User logs into their bank account (Website A).
	    - Attacker sends a phishing link or tricks them into visiting Website B.
	    - Website B uses scripts to send malicious requests to Website A, using the user's browser and session cookie to carry out unauthorized actions.
	      
	4. **Impact**: CSRF attacks can lead to unauthorized transactions, data theft, or other malicious activities on trusted sites.
	   
	5. **Prevention**:
	    - **CSRF Tokens**: Implementing tokens that must be included in requests for them to be valid.
	    - **Same-Origin Policy**: Ensuring that browsers restrict cross-site requests based on the origin of the request (domain, protocol, and port).
	    - **Secure Coding Practices**: Following best practices to prevent such vulnerabilities.
	      
- **Expiration Time**: 
	- Cookies Expire the moment the session ends. (Browser/Tab Closed)
	- In .NET Cookies can be set persistent from the AuthenticationHandler by setting the `isPersistant` flag to `True`.
	- In .NET the Cookie life time span can be adjusted by the `ExpireTimeSpan` option of the `CookieAuthenticationOptions`
	- Sliding Expiration: Sliding Expiration aims to prevent cookies from expiring during user interactions by extending their validity upon each request. Each time the authentication server receives a request containing the cookie, it updates the cookie's expiration time by a few seconds. This ensures the session remains active as long as the user continues making requests. Once no further requests are detected, the cookie expires.
