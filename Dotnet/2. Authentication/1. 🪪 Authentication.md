## üîç What is Authentication?

Authentication in its simplest form is the answer to the question: "Who are you?"

Authenticating a user involves establishing a set of claims that define the user within a specific schema.

A user can be authenticated using different schemas, much like how a citizen can be identified through various forms of identification such as a Driving License, Passport, or ID. For example, government ministries‚Äîsuch as the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or the Ministry of Internal Affairs‚Äîcan verify your identity based on specific claims they have collected about you.

For instance, the claims in your driving license include your name, ID number, types of vehicles allowed to drive, and blood type. Similarly, the claims in your ID might include your address, mother's name, marital status, and so on. The point is that each schema can authenticate the user based on a set of specific claims tailored to that particular schema.

## üîçAuthentication in .Dotnet

**In the context of .NET and ASP.NET Core, authentication typically involves:**

1. **Verifying User Credentials**: This could be through username/password combinations, API keys, OAuth tokens, or other methods.
2. **Maintaining Security Context**: Once a user is authenticated, their identity is maintained throughout their session (if using sessions) or across requests (using tokens like JWT).
3. **Integrating with Identity Providers**: .NET applications can integrate with external identity providers such as Google, Microsoft Azure AD, Facebook, or OAuth providers to streamline authentication.

**Key Components of Authentication in .NET**

1. **Authentication Methods**:
    - **Forms Authentication**: Uses cookies to maintain the user's login state across multiple requests.
    - **Windows Authentication**: Integrates with Windows accounts for Single Sign-On (SSO) in domain environments.
    - **Token-Based Authentication**: Uses tokens (e.g., JWT) to authenticate users without sessions, which is common in RESTful APIs.
2. **Identity Providers**:
    - Built-in support for local user accounts (ASP.NET Identity).
    - Integration with external providers like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.
3. **Security Tokens**:
    - **Cookies**: Used for session-based authentication.
    - **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Stateless tokens used for authenticating users in stateless systems like APIs.
4. **Roles and Claims**:
    - After a user is authenticated, their roles or claims can be checked to authorize access to specific resources.

**Understanding the Code of Authentication in .NET**

---

1. **Claim in .NET: A Concise Overview:**
	* In .NET, **claims** are key-value pairs that define aspects of a user's identity and permissions within a system. Claims can include information such as the user's name, email, roles, and other attributes.
	* Claim Types can be one of many predefined types that Dotnet provides or any custom value.
		```csharp
		// Create a claim for the user's role
		var adminClaim = new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, "Admin");
		var nameClaim = new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name,"John Doe");
		var customClaim = new Claim("IsAMikuLover","YESSS");
		```
2. **Identity in .NET: A Concise Overview:**
	- A collection of claims that represent a user's identity and roles within a system. An instance of `ClaimsIdentity` in .NET encapsulates a set of claims about the current user.

		```csharp
		string scheme = "MySchemeName"
		Claims[] claims = 
		[
			adminClaim,
			nameClaim,
			customClaim
		];
		var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims,scheme);
		```
		* When creating a `ClaimsIdentity`, providing a scheme name helps in:
			1. **Differentiating Authentication Methods**: It allows the system to recognize which authentication provider was used (e.g., "Facebook", "Google"), enabling tailored handling for each method.
			2.  **Enforcing Role-Based Access Control**: The scheme can influence how claims are validated or interpreted, ensuring that actions permissible via one provider differ from another if needed.
			3. **Token-Based Authentication**: For systems using tokens (like JWT), the scheme name helps in validating and routing requests correctly based on the authentication provider.
3. **Claims Principal in .NET: A Concise Overview:** 
	- A **Claims Principal** in .NET is an object that encapsulates the identity and claims of the principal (user or service) making a request. It serves as a central hub for authentication and authorization data, enabling systems to enforce security policies based on the claims provided.
	- Here's a concise code example demonstrating how to create a `ClaimsPrincipal` in .NET:
		```csharp
		using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
		using System.Security.Claims;
		
		// Create an array of claims for the principal
		var claims = new Claim[]
		{
			new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, "John Doe"),
			new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, "Admin")
		};
		
		//Create ClaimsIdentity with the provided claims and authentication scheme
		var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, "YourAuthenticationScheme");
		
		// Wrap the identity in a ClaimsPrincipal
		var principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(identity);
		
		```
4. **Authentication Schemes in .NET: A Simple Explanation:**
	1. **What is an Authentication Scheme?**
	   
	    - An¬†**Authentication Scheme**¬†defines the method or provider used to authenticate users within a web application.
	    - It specifies how the system verifies user identities, such as using email and password, social media logins (e.g., Google, Facebook), or token-based authentication.  
	2. **Built-in Authentication Schemes in .NET:
		- **Cookies**: Traditional form login where credentials are stored in cookies for maintaining sessions.
	    - **OpenIdConnect**: Implements OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols for third-party logins (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
	    - **JwtBearerToken**: Handles JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, enabling stateless token-based access control.
	3. Setting the Default Auth Schema in Dotnet
		* Custom Scheme
			```csharp
			// Whatever set between () 
			//becomes the default scheme for the application
			services.AddAuthentication("NameOfScheme")
			//By default it is set to 
			//ApplicationScheme from AuthenticationConstants
			``` 
	4. **Creating a Custom Authentication Scheme:**
	    - To create a custom scheme:
	        1. Implement¬†`IAuthorizationHandler`¬†to define your custom authentication logic.
	        2. Register the new scheme using¬†`AuthenticationBuilder`¬†in the application's services configuration.
5. **Example of Adding Built-in Schemes in ASP.NET Core:**
	* Built In Schemes
		```csharp
		public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
		{
			// Add your custom handler implementation
			 services.AddTransient<IAuthorizationHandler, CustomAuthHandler>();
		
			// Adding Authentication schemes
			services.AddAuthentication()
					.AddCookie(options =>
					{
						options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login";
						options.LogoutPath = "/Account/Logout";
						options.AccessDeniedPath = "/Account/AccessDenied";
					})
					.AddOpenIdConnect("oidc", options =>
					{
						// Configuration for OpenID Connect
						options.Authority = "https://localhost:5001"; 
						options.ClientId = "mvc";
						options.ClientSecret = "secret";
						options.ResponseType = "code";
						options.Scope.Add("openid");
						options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";
					})
					.AddScheme<CustomAuthHandler>("custom", options => { });;
		}
		```
	* Custom Scheme and Custom Handler
		```csharp
			//CustomAuthHandler is  a class that inherits from
			//`SignInAuthenticationHandler` and 
			//could be used to create custom authentication logic
			public class CustomAuthHandler :
			SignInAuthenticationHandler<AuthenticationSchemeOptions>
			{  
				public VisitorAuthenticationHandler(  
				IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options,  
				ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder) : base(
				options, logger, encoder)  {  }
			
				protected override Task HandleSignOutAsync(
				AuthenticationProperties? properties)  
				{  
				    throw new NotImplementedException();  
				}  
			  
				protected override Task HandleSignInAsync(
				ClaimsPrincipal user, 
				AuthenticationProperties? properties)  
				{  
				    throw new NotImplementedException();  
				}
			
			}
		```
6. **Authentication Handler in .NET: A Step-by-Step Explanation:**
	1. **What is an Authentication Handler?**
		 - Authentication Handler is a component within the ASP.NET Core authentication middleware that processes incoming requests to determine if a user is authenticated.
		 - Authentication Handler Contains two main Methods `SignInAsync` and `SignOutAsync`.
	2. **Key Responsibilities of an Authentication Handler:**
		 - **Extracting Credentials:** Retrieves authentication tokens, cookies, or headers from the incoming request.
		 - **Validating Credentials:** Checks the extracted credentials against a backend store (e.g., user database) to verify their validity.
		 - **Populating Claims Principal:** If authentication is successful, it creates a `ClaimsPrincipal` object containing the user's claims for use throughout the application.
	3. **Built-in Authentication Schemes and Handlers:** 
		 - **Cookies Handler:** Validates cookies containing authentication tokens.
		 - **BearerTokenHandler**: Processes token-based authentication.  
7. **Understanding Internal and External Identity Schemas in .NET**

	- In .NET, authentication is handled through schemas, which define methods or systems used to authenticate users. There are two main types: internal and external identity schemas.
	
	1. **Internal Identity Schema:**
		* **Definition:** This schema refers to authenticating users who have accounts within your application's database.
		- **Usage:** It typically involves using ASP.NET Identity to manage user registration, login, and role-based access control directly within your application.
		- **Configuration:** In your `Program.cs`, you can configure internal authentication by adding local account support. For example:
		```csharp
		 builder
		   .Services
			 .AddAuthentication()
			 .AddCookie(oAuthCookieScheme, o => {})
		```

	2. **External Identity Schema:**
	   - **Definition:** This schema involves integrating with third-party authentication services to allow users to log in using external accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft).
	   - **Usage:** It leverages protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to enable social logins.
	   - **Configuration:** You can add external providers using the `AuthenticationBuilder`. For instance, adding Google authentication:
	     ```csharp
	     builder
		   .Services
			 .AddAuthentication()
			 .AddOAuth(o => {
				 //SignInScheme = Internal Identity Schema
					 o.SignInScheme = oAuthCookieScheme; 
					 o.ClientId = "your_OAuth_client_id";
					 o.ClientSecret = "your_OAuth_client_secret";
					//Mock Server  
					o.AuthorizationEndpoint = "/oauth/authorize";  
					o.TokenEndpoint = "/oauth/token";  
					o.UserInformationEndpoint = "/userinfo";  
					o.CallbackPath = "/OAuthCallback";
					o.Scope.Add("Oauth");
					o.SaveTokens = true;
				 });
	     ```
8. **Authentication Http Context Extensions**

	`AuthenticationHttpContextExtensions` is a collection of extension methods in ASP.NET Core that facilitate common authentication tasks such as authenticating users, challenging unauthenticated requests, forbidding access based on roles or policies, signing users in, signing users out, and retrieving authentication tokens. These methods simplify the implementation of security features within middleware or controllers by providing straightforward abstractions for handling different aspects of the authentication process.

	1. **AuthenticateAsync**: Authenticate the current request using the default authentication scheme. The default authentication scheme

	2. **ChallengeAsync**: Challenge the current request using the default challenge scheme. An authentication challenge can be issued when an unauthenticated user requests an endpoint that requires authentication.

	3. **ForbidAsync**: Forbid the current request using the specified scheme. Forbid is used when an authenticated user attempts to access a resource they are not permitted to access.

	4. **SignInAsync**: Sign in a principal for the specified scheme

	5. **SignOutAsync**: Sign out a principal for the specified scheme.

	6. **GetTokenAsync**: Authenticates the request using the specified scheme and returns the value for the token.
