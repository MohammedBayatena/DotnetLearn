ðŸ“˜ **Cookie SSO (Single Sign-On):**

Cookie-based Single Sign-On (SSO) is a method used to enable users to log in once and access multiple related websites, applications, or services without needing to authenticate again for each individual service. This system leverages cookies stored on the user's browser to maintain their authenticated state across these domains.

**Mechanism:**

1. **Initial Login:**Â When a user logs into one of the affiliated services (e.g., an email account), a special cookie is set in their browser. This cookie typically contains an identifier unique to the user's session.
    
2. **Cross-Domain Recognition:**Â As the user navigates to other related sites or applications, these domains recognize the cookie and use its identifier to authenticate the user without requiring them to log in again.
    
3. **Session Management:**Â The authentication server handles these cookies, ensuring they are valid and up-to-date across all participating services. This allows for seamless access while maintaining security.
