## 🔍 Cloning Your Favorite Toy

Imagine you have **a favorite teddy bear**.

Now, your friend says:

> “I want the same teddy!”

Instead of **making a new one from scratch**, you say:

> “Let me use my **magic cloning machine**!” 🧙‍♂️✨

You put your teddy inside… and out comes **an identical copy** — same eyes, same smile, same bowtie.

🎉 That’s the **Prototype Pattern**.

---

## 🔍 What is the Prototype Pattern?

The **Prototype Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that lets you:

- **Create new objects by copying existing ones**
    
- Avoid re-building complex objects from scratch

---

## 🔍 When Should You Use It?

Use the Prototype Pattern when:

✅Creating a new object is **expensive** (e.g., involves lots of setup or memory)
✅ You want to **avoid subclassing**, and prefer copying an object
✅ You need **many similar objects** quickly
✅ You want to keep creation logic **outside of client code**

---

## 🧑‍💻 C# Example: Cloning a Toy Object

Let’s build a prototype system for cloning a **toy**.

---

### Step 1: Create the Prototype Interface

```csharp
public interface IToyPrototype
{
    IToyPrototype Clone();
}
```

---

### Step 2: Create a Toy Class that Implements It

```csharp
public class Toy : IToyPrototype
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Color { get; set; }

    public IToyPrototype Clone()
    {
        // Create a shallow copy
        return (IToyPrototype)this.MemberwiseClone();
    }

    public void Show()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Toy: {Name}, Color: {Color}");
    }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Use the Clone Method in Your Program

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create original toy
        Toy originalToy = new Toy { Name = "Teddy Bear", Color = "Brown" };
        originalToy.Show();

        // Clone the toy
        Toy clonedToy = (Toy)originalToy.Clone();
        clonedToy.Color = "Blue";  // Customize the clone

        clonedToy.Show();
        originalToy.Show();  // Original remains unchanged
    }
}
```

🖨️ **Output:**

```
Toy: Teddy Bear, Color: Brown
Toy: Teddy Bear, Color: Blue
Toy: Teddy Bear, Color: Brown
```

## 🧠 Deep Clone vs Shallow Clone

- **Shallow Clone**: Copies the top-level values (like strings, numbers), but shared objects are still the same reference
    
- **Deep Clone**: Copies **everything**, including inner objects (useful when your object has complex nested data)
    

In .NET, `MemberwiseClone()` creates a **shallow copy**.  
To do a deep copy, you'd need to manually copy all nested objects.

## 🎯 Benefits of the Prototype Pattern

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Fast cloning|Avoids slow or complex object creation|
|Simplifies object creation|No need to build object from scratch|
|Reduces dependencies|No need to know how object is built internally|
|Flexible|Each prototype can be customized after cloning|

---

## 🎁 Summary

|Concept|What It Means|
|---|---|
|Prototype|A template object that can make **clones**|
|Use Case|When you want **copies of toys** with changes|
|Real World|Photoshop: Duplicate a layer or shape|
